Hello I am Kevin and I am a recent graduate with an Associate of Science degree in Computer Information Systems from Pikes Peak State College. I am excited to embark on my professional journey into the world of technology. My coursework helped to develop solid foundations in key areas such as database management, programming, and computer administration. Through my experiences in school I have been able to apply those skills to hands-on projects where I have been able to demonstrate my ability to contribute to team objectives, analyze performance, and quality control. My love for technology coupled with my passion for helping people has driven me to pursue a career where I can make the most meaningful impact. Whether it is improving customer experience, technical support, or the never ending call of efficiency, I will use my skills to make sure that systems run seemlessly to enhance the everyday lives of a customer.

<h2>About Me...</h2>
  Over my time in the workforce, I have done many things, but typically it has revolved around technology, first in sales, then turning to Tech Support. I have a love of helping people and have always strived to deliver the best support and experience I can to a customer. I use my experiences from being a Father of three, being a support specialist and being a trainer at my previous employer to work with customers I feel in a unique way that helps guide them to not only their answers, but knowledge to tackle situations themselves in the future. As I stated previously, I am a Father of three, a gamer (both tabletop and video), a huge fan of science fiction and lover of technology.
