<h2>About Me...</h2>
  Over my time in the workforce, I have done many things, but typically it has revolved around technology, first in sales, then turning to Tech Support. I have a love of helping people and have always strived to deliver the best support and experience I can to a customer. I use my experiences from being a Father of three, being a support specialist and being a trainer at my previous employer to work with customers I feel in a unique way that helps guide them to not only their answers, but knowledge to tackle situations themselves in the future. As I stated previously, I am a Father of three, a gamer (both tabletop and video), a huge fan of science fiction and lover of technology.
